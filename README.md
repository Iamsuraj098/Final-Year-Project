# Blockchain-Based Identity Management System

This project explores the use of blockchain technology to build a secure, decentralized identity management system that overcomes the limitations of traditional centralized models. It supports self-sovereign identity (SSI), verifiable credentials (VCs), and user-controlled data access â€” enabling privacy, transparency, and interoperability.

## About the Project

Traditional identity systems are prone to data breaches, privacy violations, and a lack of user control. This project aims to design and document a decentralized identity framework using blockchain â€” allowing users to manage and share their identity securely across platforms.

---

## Key Features

- Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
- Blockchain-based verifiable credentials
- Selective data disclosure and consent management
- Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
- GDPR-friendly off-chain storage options
- High-level security and privacy

---

## Technologies Used

- Blockchain (Ethereum / Hyperledger / Sovrin)
- Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- DID & VC Standards (W3C)
- IPFS / Off-chain storage
- Markdown & DOCX for research documentation
- Python (optional: for data extraction or automation)

---

## System Architecture

- Identity creation and registration on blockchain
- Verifiable credential issuance via trusted issuers
- Selective disclosure during authentication
- Smart contract-based identity verification
- Off-chain storage for large or private data

_Refer to the "User Creates Identity" and "IdM Overview" diagrams inside the report._

---

## Use Cases

- E-Government and Digital Voting
- Banking and KYC Verification
- Healthcare Record Management
- Education Credentials and Certificates
- IoT Device Identity

## ðŸ› How to Use

> This project is primarily academic and conceptual.  
> To deploy a prototype:

1. Clone this repository
2. Review the DOCX documentation
3. Set up a local Ethereum environment (e.g., Ganache + Truffle)
4. Develop smart contracts for identity issuance and verification
5. Optionally connect to an IPFS node for off-chain storage
6. Build a simple UI for credential management (React, Python Flask, etc.)

---

## Future Work

- Implement key recovery solutions (social recovery, biometrics)
- Integrate zero-knowledge proofs for stronger privacy
- Enable cross-chain interoperability
- Test at scale with simulated network load
- Collaborate with government/institutional partners for pilots
